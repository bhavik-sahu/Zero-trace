Provide detailed, actionable suggestions focusing on the following areas for improvement:

1.  **Visual Hierarchy & Readability:**
    * How can typography be refined (font weights, sizes, line heights) to guide the user's eye more effectively? Suggest specific improvements for the main hero text, subtitles, card titles, and body text.
    * Are the compliance badges visually distinct enough? How can their presentation be improved for emphasis?
    * Suggest adjustments to spacing (padding, margins, line spacing) to reduce visual clutter and improve flow, especially within the cards and between sections.

2.  **Color Palette & Contrast:**
    * While the dark theme is sleek, are there opportunities to introduce subtle accent colors or adjust existing shades for better contrast and visual interest, without being distracting?
    * Evaluate the contrast of text against backgrounds. Are all elements optimally legible for various users?

3.  **Micro-interactions & Polish (Implied/Potential):**
    * Suggest subtle hover effects for navigation items, buttons, and feature cards to indicate interactivity.
    * How could loading states or transitions be hinted at (e.g., when clicking 'Get Started')?
    * Consider the visual treatment of the navigation bar's active state for the current page.

4.  **Overall Aesthetic & Branding:**
    * How can the 'ZeroTrace' logo and title in the top-left be more integrated or visually impactful?
    * Are there opportunities to use subtle background textures, gradients, or shadows to add depth and a premium feel without overcomplicating the design?
    * Evaluate the alignment and consistency of elements across the page.

5.  **Call-to-Action (CTA) Optimization:**
    * Can the primary 'Get Started' button be made more enticing through color, size, or an icon?
    * Are the secondary CTA buttons within the cards (`Download Now →`, `Upload Now →`, `Verify Certificate →`) clearly distinguishable and well-aligned?

6.  **Accessibility Considerations:**
    * Suggest improvements related to font sizing, contrast ratios, and interactive element states to ensure a more inclusive user experience.
