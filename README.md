üíø ZeroTrace: The E-Waste Data Sanitization Solution
ZeroTrace is a secure, cross-platform data wiping application designed to combat India's growing e-waste crisis. Our tool provides a user-friendly, verifiable, and auditable solution for securely erasing data from electronic devices, enabling safe and confident recycling.

üöÄ The Problem We're Solving
India generates over 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste annually, but a significant amount of old laptops, smartphones, and other IT assets remain unused or improperly discarded. The primary barrier is the fear of data breaches. Users are concerned that sensitive personal or corporate data can be recovered from their devices, even after a factory reset. This has led to an estimated ‚Çπ50,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded, obstructing circular economy efforts. Existing solutions are often complex, expensive, or lack verifiable proof of erasure.

ZeroTrace was built to bridge this gap by providing a simple, trustworthy, and affordable data sanitization tool.

‚ú® Key Features
Secure Data Erasure: Wipes all user data, including hidden storage areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors, ensuring nothing is left behind.

Verifiable Proof: Generates a digitally signed, tamper-proof wipe certificate in both PDF and JSON formats. This certificate serves as an auditable record of the data sanitization process.

Intuitive Interface: Features a one-click interface that is easy for the general public to use, removing the technical complexity of data wiping.

Offline Usability: The solution can be used offline, including through a bootable ISO/USB drive, making it accessible in any environment.

Third-Party Verification: The generated wipe certificate can be verified by third parties, promoting trust and transparency in IT asset disposal and recycling workflows.

Standards-Compliant: Aligned with the NIST SP 800-88 guidelines, a globally recognized standard for media sanitization.

üì± Getting Started (Android)
Our solution is cross-platform, but we've started with Android to address the massive number of smartphones in circulation.

Prerequisites
An Android device running Android 7.0 or newer.

A USB-C cable for connecting the device to a computer (optional for some features).

Important: Make sure to back up any data you want to keep. This process is irreversible!

Installation
Download the ZeroTrace Android APK from our official website or GitHub Releases page.

Install the APK on your device. You may need to enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device's settings.

Launch the ZeroTrace app.

üìù Usage
One-Click Wipe
Open the ZeroTrace app.

Tap the large "One-Click Wipe" button.

The app will prompt you to confirm the action and warn you that all data will be permanently deleted.

Confirm the wipe. The process will begin and you'll see a progress bar.

Once complete, a wipe certificate will be generated. You can save this as a PDF or JSON file to your device or share it via email.

üìú Technical Details
ZeroTrace uses a combination of secure overwrite methods to ensure data is irrecoverable. The core of our solution is the data wiping engine, which is compliant with the NIST SP 800-88 standard. The tamper-proof certificate is generated using cryptographic hashing and digital signatures, ensuring its authenticity and integrity.

The Android version of ZeroTrace leverages low-level disk access to sanitize hidden and inaccessible partitions, going far beyond a simple factory reset.
