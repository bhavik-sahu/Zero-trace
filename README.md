üíø ZeroTrace: The E-Waste Data Sanitization Solution
ZeroTrace is a secure, cross-platform data wiping solution designed to combat India's growing e-waste crisis. Our tool provides a user-friendly, verifiable, and auditable method for securely erasing data from electronic devices, enabling safe and confident recycling.

üöÄ The Problem We're Solving
India generates over 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste annually, yet millions of old devices remain unused or improperly discarded. The primary barrier is the fear of data breaches. Users are concerned that sensitive personal or corporate data can be recovered, even after a factory reset. This has led to an estimated ‚Çπ50,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded, obstructing circular economy efforts. Existing solutions are often complex, expensive, or lack verifiable proof of erasure.

ZeroTrace was built to bridge this gap by providing a simple, trustworthy, and affordable data sanitization tool.

‚ú® Key Features
Secure Data Erasure: Wipes all user data, including hidden storage areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors, ensuring nothing is left behind.

Verifiable Proof: Generates a digitally signed, tamper-proof wipe certificate in both PDF and JSON formats. This certificate serves as an auditable record of the data sanitization process.

Intuitive Interface: Features a one-click interface that is easy for the general public to use, removing the technical complexity of data wiping.

Offline Usability: The solution is bootable and runs completely offline, ensuring no data is ever transmitted during the wiping process.

Third-Party Verification: The generated wipe certificate can be verified by third parties, promoting trust and transparency in IT asset disposal and recycling workflows.

Standards-Compliant: Aligned with the NIST SP 800-88 guidelines, a globally recognized standard for media sanitization.

üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started (Windows & Linux)
ZeroTrace is designed as a bootable USB drive, allowing it to bypass the operating system and securely access all storage sectors.

Prerequisites
A USB drive (minimum 4GB recommended).

The ZeroTrace ISO file (download from our Releases Page).

A computer with Windows or Linux.

Creating the Bootable USB
Download a USB bootable creator tool like Rufus or Etcher.

Insert your USB drive into your computer.

Open the USB creation tool and select the ZeroTrace ISO file.

Choose your USB drive as the destination and click "Start".

Wait for the process to complete. You now have a bootable ZeroTrace USB.

üì± Wiping an Android Device
To ensure the most secure and thorough wipe, ZeroTrace uses a separate computer to wipe an Android device. This method allows us to bypass Android's security features and access low-level storage.

Prerequisites
A Windows or Linux computer.

The Android device to be wiped.

A USB cable to connect the Android device to the computer.

The Process
Boot your computer from the ZeroTrace USB drive.

Connect your Android device to the computer using a USB cable.

On the ZeroTrace interface, select the connected Android device from the list of detected drives.

Confirm the wipe and the process will begin.

Once the wipe is complete, a wipe certificate will be generated on your computer. You can save this as a PDF or JSON file.
